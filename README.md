## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Update Your Information

**All portfolio content is now configured in `config.json`!** This makes it easy to update your information without touching any code.

#### Editing config.json

Simply open `config.json` and edit the relevant sections:

```json
{
  "personal": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "title": "Your Title"
  },
  "about": {
    "position": "Your Position",
    "summary": ["Your bio paragraphs..."],
    "philosophy": "Your philosophy..."
  },
  "contact": {
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "github": "github.com/yourusername",
    "location": "Your City, Country"
  }
}
```

**Configuration Sections:**
- `personal` - Your name, title, and meta information
- `banner` - ASCII art and welcome message
- `about` - Professional summary and philosophy
- `skills` - Technical skills organized by category
- `experience` - Work history with detailed responsibilities
- `projects` - Portfolio projects and achievements
- `contact` - Contact information and availability
- `social` - Social media links

**Tips for Editing:**
- Use a JSON validator to ensure syntax is correct (missing commas are common!)
- Keep placeholder values like `<PLACEHOLDER>` until you're ready to fill them in
- Array items need commas between them (but not after the last item)
- Test changes by refreshing your browser

**Common Edits:**

Adding a new project:
```json
"projects": {
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "My Awesome Project",
      "description": "Built a cloud-native application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. Achieved 99.9% uptime and reduced costs by 40%."
    }
  ]
}
```

Adding a skill category:
```json
{
  "icon": "üöÄ",
  "title": "New Category",
  "items": [
    "Skill 1",
    "Skill 2"
  ]
}
```

Updating contact info:
```json
"contact": {
  "email": "me@example.com",
  "github": "github.com/myusername",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA"
}
```

### Update Meta Tags for SEO

Don't forget to update the meta tags in `index.html` for better SEO:

```html
<meta name="description" content="Your Name - Your Title">
<meta name="author" content="Your Name">
<title>Your Name - Your Title</title>
```

These need to be updated manually in the HTML file since they're used by search engines before JavaScript loads.

### Change Theme Colors

Edit `styles.css` and modify the CSS variables at the top:

```css
:root {
    --bg-primary: #0a0e27;        /* Main background */
    --accent-cyan: #00ffff;        /* Primary accent color */
    --accent-green: #39ff14;       /* Secondary accent color */
    /* ... more variables ... */
}
```

## üì¶ Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Option 1: Quick Deploy

2. Push your code:

   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
4. Under "Source", select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder
5. Click Save
6. Your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/portfolio/`

### Option 2: Custom Domain

2. Add a `CNAME` file in the root directory with your domain:
   ```
   yourdomain.com
   ```
3. Configure your domain's DNS settings:
   - Add an A record pointing to GitHub's IP addresses
   - Or add a CNAME record pointing to `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
4. In GitHub Settings ‚Üí Pages, enter your custom domain
5. Enable "Enforce HTTPS"
