    "position": "Senior Systems Architect",
    "summary": [
      "I am a Senior Systems Architect specializing in designing and implementing scalable, secure, and cost-efficient infrastructure solutions across cloud, hybrid, and on-prem environments. With over 10 years of hands-on experience, I've led technical transformations for AI-driven healthcare platforms, education technology companies, and enterprise SaaS providers.",
      "",
      "At Aiforia Technologies, I architect cloud infrastructure that supports AI/ML workloads in regulated healthcare environments. As a member of the cybersecurity team and HIPAA Security Officer, I integrate secure-by-design principles into every layer of the stack. My work spans multi-cloud orchestration (GCP, Azure, AWS), containerized deployments with Kubernetes and Docker, and Infrastructure as Code with Terraform — all tailored to meet strict compliance and performance needs.",
      "",
      "Previously, at Read Naturally, I directed full-spectrum infrastructure initiatives — from cloud migrations and DevOps pipeline automation to disaster recovery and cost-optimization strategies. My foundation in Linux systems administration and scripting, combined with a collaborative approach to cross-functional teamwork, enables me to solve complex challenges efficiently and sustainably."
    ],
    "philosophy": "I bring a holistic, security-first perspective to every project — ensuring that the systems I build are not only robust and scalable but also aligned with real business outcomes."
